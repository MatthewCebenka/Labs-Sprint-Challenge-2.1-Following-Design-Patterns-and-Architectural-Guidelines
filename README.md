## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Journal Entry.**

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Journal Entry. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

We have allocated time on your schedule to ensure that you get this done at the end of each sprint.

- For Full Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before 11am PST every Friday.
- For Part Time Students: Please submit your work on this journal entry before the end of your B-Week Thursday class period.

## Prompt 1

For this response, please focus on your individual contributions.

**Engineers:**

Describe your contribution to your team's goals this sprint.

- How did you ensure that you implemented the designer's vision accurately?
By constantly referencing the design file and running changes by my PM. Also getting feedback from the steakholder. 
- What were the biggest challenges you faced this sprint?
Implementing a d3 bubble map. The d3 library doesn't natively support react so I am making my own mini library for my application.
- Describe the data layer of your application. (Feel free to pick a single model and break down the required fields for that resource. Are there any relationships? e.g. 1 to many, many to 1, etc.).
- Describe your product's application structure and code patterns. Why or why not is your team using a linter? If applicable, describe the structure of your API.
We are using prettier and ESLint. Our API is a rest node rest api with a mysql database and graphql.

**UX designers:**

Describe how you communicated the design direction to your team.

- Describe the relationship with your stakeholder.
- If you started your design system, describe how you selected key styles including colors and typography. How did the target users influence your visual design decisions?

**Data scientists:**

Describe your process of working with the engineering and design teams.

- How did design/engineering help guide the solution to the product's data science problems?

## Prompt 2 - To be completed if your team deviated from your plan

Now that you've been through or are nearly completing a full product release cycle, we'd like to know how your plan changed.

**Please fill out if, during this release canvas, you deviated from your original plan**
